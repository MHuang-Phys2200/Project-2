####Internal Structure of White Dwarf Stars

Two dimensionless differential equations were derived for the mass and density of a white
dwarf star as a function of radius. Initial conditions ( mass and density at r = 0) are
mass = 0 and density = rho_c, which varies from .08 to 10e6 in this report. 

* **Density Vs Radius**

The graph shows the density of a white dwarf star with an initial density of 10 as a function of radius. As radius increases, density decreases until the density drops below zero. At this point the starreaches its maximum radius and the points beyond this are meaningless.

* **Radius Vs Mass**

This  shows the radius and the mass of white dwarf stars with initial densities ranging from 0.08 to 1,000,000. The graph shows that as mass increases radius actually decreases.
