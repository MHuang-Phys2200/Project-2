####Internal Structure of White Dwarf Stars

Two dimensionless differential equations were derived for the mass and density of a white
dwarf star as a function of radius. Initial conditions ( mass and density at r = 0) are
mass = 0 and density = rho_c, which varies from .08 to 10e6 in this report. 

* **Density Vs Radius**
